# _Trypanosoma brucei_ web-scraping
This repository contains Python notebooks compiling the code for programmatic access to UniProt REST API service and web scraping of PDB site. This work was undertaken by me,
under the expert guidance of Dr. Atlanta Cook, Wellcome Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh.

***Glyco_uniprot_RESTAPI.ipynb*** & ***unannotated_list_UniP.ipynb*** files showcases the code for access to the RESTAPI service of UniProt and parsing the resulting data. The two
files have slight variations to the code based on the data obtained from the API.

***Unannotated_list_Pdb.ipynb*** file contains code for web scraping of the PDB site using _BeautifulSoup_ library. Huge thanks to Paul Mclaughlin for the code!!
