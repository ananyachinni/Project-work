# Pancreatic Cancer Bioinformatics Analysis
This repository contains R scripts of Pancreatic Cancer bioinformatics analysis undertaken in collaboration with Dr. Payel Ghosh and her doctoral student, Ms. Priyanka Gawade.

+ _PC_RNA-Seq_analysis_:

 This sub-repository contains the sample code for producing Chord plots, Cluster plots using GOplot (Goplot_DEGs.R), Dotplots for KEGG data using ggplot2 library
 (KEGG_Dotplot_ggplot2.R), Volcano plot for differentially expressed genes using EnhancedVolcano library (mrna_Volcano_plot.R).
+ _PC_miRNA-Seq_analysis_:

 This sub-repository holds scripts for Volcano plot of the differentially expressed miRNAs (mirna_Volcano_plot.R), differential expression analysis pipeline for the miRNA 
 expression profiles using DESeq2 package (mirna_deseq2.R).
