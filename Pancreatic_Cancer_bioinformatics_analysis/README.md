# Pancreatic Cancer Bioinformatics Analysis
This repository contains R scripts of Pancreatic Cancer bioinformatics analysis undertaken in collaboration with Dr. Payel Ghosh and her doctoral student, Ms. Priyanka Gawade.

+ _PC_RNA-Seq_analysis_:

 This sub-repository contains the sample code for differential expression analysis of the mRNA expression profiles using DESeq2 package (mrna_DESeq2.R), for producing Chord plots, Cluster plots using GOplot (Goplot_DEGs.R), Dotplots for KEGG data using ggplot2 library (KEGG_Dotplot_ggplot2.R), Volcano plot for differentially expressed genes using EnhancedVolcano library (mrna_Volcano_plot.R).
+ _PC_miRNA-Seq_analysis_:

 This sub-repository holds scripts for differential expression analysis pipeline of the miRNA expression profiles using DESeq2 package (mirna_deseq2.R), Volcano plot of the 
 differentially expressed miRNAs (mirna_Volcano_plot.R), heatmap of miRNA functional enrichment data using ComplexHeatmap library (mirna_ComplexHeatmap.R).
